# Earthquake-Classification-on-IIIT-H-dataset

Used the `IIIT Hyderabad Reasearch Lab` dataset to classify the earthquakes

Used 3 different classification algorithms namely `KNN`,`Decision Tree` and `AdaBoost` for classification

Measured the accuracies of the 3 algorithms as well as compared them using `ROC PLOTS AND ROC CURVES`
